<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>When I was in Australia for a year, I lived above a Thai restaurant. They made the best green curry I've ever tasted. I was a regular customer and I managed to persuade the chef to let me know how he made the curry. I've adapted it slightly to bring down the heat but it's still got a nice kick to it. Apparently the paste will keep in the fridge for up to 4 months! This one uses prawns but feel free to use chicken.</p>
  <p>Serves 4</p>

    <li>Add all the paste ingredients into a food processor and blend to form a thick smooth paste or chop all the paste ingredients very finely and mix to blend.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil to very hot in a wok and stir fry the beans and baby corn for 40 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add the curry paste and then the coconut milk and bring to the boil.</li>
